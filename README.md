## Shortest Path Algorithms

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
The Bellman-Ford algorithm computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph, handling graphs with negative weight edges.

**Steps to Run:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project
3. Build and run `BellmanFord.cpp`

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph, ensuring non-negative edge weights.

**Steps to Run:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project
3. Build and run `Dijkstra.cpp`

## Geometric Algorithms

### Convex Hull
The Convex Hull algorithm computes the smallest convex polygon that can enclose a set of points in a two-dimensional space. It's useful in various fields, including computer graphics and computational geometry.

**Steps to Run:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project
3. Build and run `ConvexHull.cpp`

## Graph Connectivity and Structure

### Cut Vertices (DFS)
This implementation finds cut vertices (or articulation points) in a graph using Depth-First Search (DFS). A cut vertex is a vertex which, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.

**Steps to Run:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project
3. Build and run `CutVerticesDFS.cpp`

## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms

### Prim's Algorithm
Prim's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph by growing the tree one edge at a time.

**Steps to Run:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project
3. Build and run `PrimsAlgorithm.cpp`

### Kruskal's Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph by sorting edges and adding them one by one, ensuring no cycles are formed.

**Steps to Run:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project
3. Build and run `KruskalsAlgorithm.cpp`

## Data Compression

### Huffman Coding
Huffman coding is a compression algorithm that creates a binary tree based on the frequency of characters to achieve variable-length encoding for optimal data compression.

**Steps to Run:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project
3. Build and run `HuffmanCoding.cpp`
